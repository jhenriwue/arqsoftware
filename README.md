# ADR 0003: Plugin Architecture for Communication Platform Integration

**Owner:** @gims-architecture-team  
**Status:** Proposed  
**Created:** 2025-07-01  
**Review Date:** 2025-07-08  
**Issue:** #gims-backend-003

---

## Overview

GIMS must interact with several external communication systems (e.g., Discord, Google Groups) and may need to support more platforms in the future. This document records the decision to formalize and modularize those integrations using a plugin architecture.

---

## Context

The core requirement is to automatically manage communication channels and their memberships, based on the data coming from a university or corporate management system.  
Initially, GIMS connects with Discord and Google Groups, but stakeholders foresee the need to support more tools (such as Slack or Teams).  
Previously, each integration was handled ad hoc—tightly coupled in the backend codebase—which made code harder to extend and maintain as new communication tools were requested.

---

## Decision

**We will create a plugin system for communication integrations.**  
All communication with third-party messaging platforms will be mediated through a well-defined internal plugin interface, designed for easy expansion.

- Each supported platform (Discord, Google Groups, etc) will have its own plugin, implementing the standard interface.
- The core backend will dynamically load and dispatch actions (create group, add/remove member, post message) to the relevant plugin(s), depending on the admin/user’s choices.
- The plugin interface will encapsulate all necessary actions and error handling for platform communication.
- New integrations can be added as separate modules, without requiring changes to core backend logic.

**Why:**  
- Allows support for new platforms without changing backend business logic.
- Improves maintainability, testability, and code clarity.
- Simplifies third-party credential and API management.

## Considered Alternatives

| Approach                                      | Advantages                                                | Drawbacks                                  | Status      |
|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------|
| All integrations in backend code (monolith)    | Quick for small N, simple at first                        | Unmanageable as N grows, tightly coupled   | Rejected    |
| Standalone microservices per integration       | Service isolation, fault containment                      | Higher infra and ops burden                | Not chosen  |
| **Plugin system (chosen)**                     | Modular, scalable, keeps backend clean, easier for tests  | Requires good interface/version control     | **Chosen**  |

---

## Consequences

- Adding new communication tools (Slack, Teams, etc) becomes straightforward—just implement a new plugin, register it, and configure.
- Teams responsible for integrations can develop and test plugins in isolation from backend feature work.
- Plugin failures or misconfigurations are isolated from core system stability.
- Extra care needed for interface versioning and backward compatibility as plugins evolve.
- Security reviews required before enabling third-party/community plugins in production.

---

## Implementation Notes

- The base interface will be defined in Python using `abc.ABC` and clear method contracts (`create_group`, `add_member`, etc).
- Plugin discovery can use setuptools entry points, config files, or explicit registration.
- Each plugin manages its own secrets/config, never exposing credentials to the core or to other plugins.
- Plugins should be stateless where possible; any stateful resource management must be documented.

---

## Open Questions

- Should plugins run in-process, or do we allow out-of-process plugins for extra isolation?
- What’s the update policy for plugins—must they be backward compatible or can we version the plugin interface?
- Will organizations be able to author and run their own plugins securely?
