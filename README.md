# ADR 0003: Plugin-Based Communication Integration Architecture

**Implementation Owner:** @gims-architecture-team  
**Start Date:** 2025-07-01  
**Target Date:** 2025-07-08  
**Internal Issue:** GIMS-BACKEND-003

---

## Summary

To support seamless integration with multiple communication platforms in GIMS, we evaluated two main approaches:

1. **Proposal A (chosen):** Implement a plugin-based architecture for communication integrations, enabling support for platforms like Discord and Gmail (Google Groups) via clearly defined interfaces.
2. **Proposal B (rejected):** Develop each integration directly in the core backend codebase, adding platform support case-by-case.

We selected Proposal A for its scalability, maintainability, and flexibility, reducing coupling and enabling independent evolution of integrations.

## 1. Context & Problem Statement

As GIMS aims to automate group/channel creation across diverse communication platforms (e.g., Discord, Gmail/Google Groups, and potentially Slack, WhatsApp, etc.), a robust and adaptable integration approach is required.

> **In the context of** expanding GIMS to support current and future communication platforms,  
> **facing** the need for scalable, maintainable, and independently deployable integrations,  
> **we decided** to adopt a plugin-based abstraction for all communication services,  
> **and neglected** hard-coding integrations in the backend,  
> **to achieve** easy extensibility and reduce maintenance burden,  
> **accepting** the trade-off of a slightly more complex interface contract and plugin management.

---

## 2. Decision Drivers

- **Extensibility:** Need to add new communication platforms with minimal changes to the core backend.
- **Maintainability:** Keep core logic independent from platform-specific implementations.
- **Decoupling:** Allow plugin development and deployment independent from the main system.
- **Consistency:** Enforce a standard contract/interface for all plugins.
- **User Choice:** Empower organizations to select preferred communication channels.

---

## 3. Design Proposal

### Proposal A (chosen)

- Define a **standard interface** (e.g., Python abstract base class) for plugins to implement, including methods like `create_group`, `add_member`, `remove_member`, `send_message`, etc.
- Plugins for Discord, Gmail/Google Groups, and future platforms implement this interface and are **registered** with the backend.
- The backend **loads** and **invokes** plugins dynamically based on configuration and user/admin choices.
- Each plugin handles its own API credentials, error handling, and mapping to platform-specific concepts (e.g., “group” in Gmail vs. “channel” in Discord).

### Proposal B (rejected)

- Implement all communication platform logic directly in the backend service code.
- Each new integration requires core code changes, increased testing burden, and risk of regression.

## 4. Alternatives Considered

| Alternative                           | Pros                                        | Cons                                                      | Decision   |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Monolithic integration in backend      | Simpler for very few platforms              | Poor scalability, code bloat, hard to maintain            | Rejected   |
| Separate microservice per integration  | High isolation, independent deployment      | Higher operational complexity, more inter-service comm.    | Considered |
| Plugin-based (selected)                | Flexible, consistent, easy to extend        | Plugin interface contract must be stable, versioning       | Chosen     |

---

## 5. Consequences

- **✔️ High extensibility:** New platforms can be supported via plugins, reducing time-to-market for integrations.
- **✔️ Maintainability:** Platform-specific code lives outside the core, enabling focused testing and updates.
- **⚠️ Interface evolution:** Careful management needed when changing the core plugin interface.
- **❗ Plugin loading:** Secure and reliable plugin loading mechanisms must be ensured to prevent misconfiguration or abuse.

## 7. Unresolved Questions

- How will plugin versioning and compatibility be managed over time?
- Should plugins run in-process or as separate microservices for security/isolation?
- What is the best mechanism for organizations to contribute or customize their own plugins?
